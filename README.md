# Retun ShowHiddenChannels
<p align="left">
    <b>The return of the "banned" plugin ShowHiddenChannels.</b><br>
    A plugin wich displays all hidden Channels, which can't be accessed due to Role Restrictions, this won't allow you to read them (impossible)
</p>

### The Story

On September 5th, 2022, Betterdiscord [announced](https://discord.com/channels/86004744966914048/178208945410801665/1016268576283426866) that plugins like ShowHiddenChannels would no longer be officially supported.

Additionally, the [plugin](https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Plugins/ShowHiddenChannels) was discontinued and removed on the same day.

### Install
- Download returnShowHiddenChannels.plugin.js from this repository
- Move it into the plugins folder
- Done

In case you have the C_BDFDB / 1BDFDB library which is no longer needed, you can remove it with its additional files: 1BDFDB.data.json, 1BDFDB.raw.css and 1BDFDB.config.json

If you get this error:

You need to delete the ShowHiddenChannels.plugin.js from the plugins folder
### Features

- Uses the original library

### TODO

- Find a way to patch the library (To add features)
- Add a DevTool toggleable setting (Instead of relying on the developer discord id)
