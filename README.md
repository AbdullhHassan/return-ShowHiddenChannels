# Retun ShowHiddenChannels
<p align="left">
    <b>The return of the "banned" plugin ShowHiddenChannels.</b><br>
</p>

### The Story

On September 5th, 2022, Betterdiscord [announced](https://discord.com/channels/86004744966914048/178208945410801665/1016268576283426866) that plugins like ShowHiddenChannels would no longer be officially supported.

Additionally, the [plugin](https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Plugins/ShowHiddenChannels) was discontinued and removed on the same day.

### Additional Features

- Removed Forced Auto Update (This shouldn't even have been here in the first place)
- Added a DevTool toggleable setting (Instead of relying on the developer discord id)
- Removed Cryptocurrency links (I don't support crypto)

### TODO

- Start using the original library
- Find a way to patch the library (To add features)
